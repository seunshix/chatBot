# Define a list of responses for the chatbot
responses = [
    "Hello, how are you?",
    "I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying.",
    "I'm just a chatbot, I don't have feelings.",
    "I'm here to help you with whatever you need. Just ask me a question and I'll do my best to answer it.",
    "I'm not sure, can you please provide more information?",
    "I'm sorry, I can't help with that. Can I assist you with something else?",
]

# Define a function to handle the user's input and provide a response
def chatbot_response(user_input):
    # Use a random response from the list of responses

# To create a chatbot, you will need to use a programming language and a framework or library for building chatbots. There are many options available, but some popular choices for creating chatbots include Python with the NLTK library, JavaScript with the BotKit library, and Java with the AIML library.

# Here is an example of a simple chatbot written in Python with the NLTK library:


import nltk
from nltk.chat.util import Chat, reflections

pairs = [    ["hi", "hello"],
    ["how are you", "I'm good, thanks for asking"],
    ["what's your name", "My name is Jasmine"]
]

chatbot = Chat(pairs, reflections)
chatbot.converse()

# In this example, the chatbot is initialized with a list of pairs that consist of a question and a response. 
# When the converse() method is called, the chatbot will enter into a conversation with the user, 
# asking and answering questions based on the pairs provided.

# You can customize the chatbot by adding more pairs, changing the responses, or even adding additional functionality. 
# For example, you could use natural language processing techniques to improve the chatbot's ability to understand 
# and respond to more complex inputs.

# I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.



# you can use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve your chatbot's ability to understand and 
# respond to more complex inputs.

# One way to do this is to use a pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3, to generate responses based on the user's input. 
# This can allow the chatbot to produce more varied and natural-sounding responses, and to understand the context of the 
# conversation more accurately.

# Here is an example of how you might use GPT-3 with the OpenAI API to generate responses for a chatbot in Python:


import openai
openai.api_key = "<YOUR API KEY>"

def generate_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1024,
        temperature=0.5
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["text"]

def chatbot(user_input):
    prompt = f"User: {user_input}\nChatbot: "
    response = generate_response(prompt)
    return response

print(chatbot("Hello, how are you?"))


# In this example, the generate_response() function uses the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the 
# provided prompt, which includes the user's input and a prompt for the chatbot's response. The chatbot() 
# function then uses this function to generate a response to the user's input.

# You can customize the chatbot by modifying the parameters of the generate_response() function, such as 
# the temperature, which controls the amount of randomness in the generated response, or the max_tokens, 
#  which controls the maximum number of tokens (i.e. words) in the generated response.

# I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

# ?Certainly! Here is some example code that you can use as a starting point for creating a sentiment analysis chatbot with a backend in Python and a frontend in JavaScript:
